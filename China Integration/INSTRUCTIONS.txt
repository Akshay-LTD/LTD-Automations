To obtain the reports, simply run main.exe and check in the Output folder for the csv and xlsx files.

NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO RENAME ANY OF THE RAW DATA FILES AS THE PROGRAM DETECTS THE FILES BY THE ORIGINAL NAMING SCHEME.
NOTE 2: THE OUTPUT FILES WILL HAVE THE SAME NAME AS THE INPUT FILES.
NOTE 3: YOU CAN DROP IN AS MANY FILES YOU WANT INTO THE INPUT FOLDER. THE PROGRAM WILL GENERATE REPORTS FOR EVERY CSV FILE IT FINDS.

If you'd like any functionality to be changed please let me (Shaun) know.
